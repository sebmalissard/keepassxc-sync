This script `keepassxc-sync.sh` was developped to synchonize your local KeePassXC database with a remote KeePassXC database over ssh.

Before use it, you need to edit the user configuration variables at the top of `keepassxc-sync.sh`.

After that, you can simply synchronize your database with:
```bash
 $ ./keepassxc-sync.sh
```
